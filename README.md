# GettingandCleaningData_Assigment
This is the week4 programming assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data course on coursera.

The script does the following functions as required:
    0. Download and unzip the files using the url. Import the ".txt" files into R 
       as data frames.
    1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for 
       each measurement.
    3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, and
       change the column name to "Activity".
    4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Did some 
       substitution in this step, such as "t" to "Time", "f" to "Frequency", delete
       unnecessary "()".
    5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
       with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Write
       the table to a txt file named "TidyData.txt".

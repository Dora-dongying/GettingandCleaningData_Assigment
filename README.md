# GettingandCleaningData_Assigment
This is the week4 programming assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data course on coursera.

The script does the following functions as required:
    * Download and unzip the files using the url. Import the ".txt" files into R 
       as data frames.
    * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for 
       each measurement.
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set, and
       change the column name to "Activity".
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. Did some 
       substitution in this step, such as "t" to "Time", "f" to "Frequency", delete
       unnecessary "()".
    * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
       with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. Write
       the table to a txt file named "TidyData.txt".
